  ## Description
  Social media is exploding these days.  There are seemingly countless examples of social media platforms, with at least one likely being available to satisfy just about anyone's needs.  This project is the beginnings of the backend of a social media application, storing unique user usernames and emails and allowing those users to add friends and add their own thoughts and react to the thoughts of other users.

  ## Installation
  
  There are three Node.js packages that this project requires: express, mongoose, and date-fns.  Express is used to create the server and create the project's api routes.  Mongoose is used to create the data models and to create the connection with the project's database.  As the project uses mongoose, that is an indication that the user will also need to install and have set up MongoDB to run the program on his/her local machine.  Date-fns is used to format dates objects that are generated when thoughts and reactions are created.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Once the required Node packages are in place and the connection to MongoDB is set up, the user can type 'npm start' on the command-line from the root of the project.  Then the user can use routing application like Insomnia or Postman to practice using the api routes.

  ## Contributing

  Perhaps one day, I will decide that I want to fully develop this application into a full-fledged social media platform to challenge some of those already out there, and should anyone believe that he or she has good ideas to use this to get there, please feel free to reach out to me through my GitHub profile listed later in this file.
  
  
  ## Tests
  
  Other than testing the api routes using Insomnia, there was no other testing done.
